# Lung Cancer Risk Analysis
### Final Team Project – Probability and Statistics for Artificial Intelligence (AAI-500)

---

## Project Overview
This project applies statistical analysis and predictive modeling to a lung cancer dataset in order to understand how behavioral and physiological risk factors relate to lung cancer diagnosis. Using probability, inferential statistics, and classification models, we aim to identify which features are most strongly associated with lung cancer risk and assess model performance under uncertainty.

This analysis demonstrates how foundational statistics support AI-driven healthcare decision making, particularly in early risk screening contexts.

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset name:** Lung Cancer Prediction Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhrubangtalukdar/lung-cancer-prediction-dataset
- **Observations:** ~300 records
- **Features:** 15 input features + 1 target variable
- **Target Variable:**
  - `LUNG_CANCER` (Binary: Yes / No)

### Feature Summary
The dataset includes demographic, behavioral, and symptom-based variables such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Smoking
- Alcohol consumption
- Chronic disease
- Fatigue
- Wheezing
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Anxiety
- Peer pressure

Most predictors are binary (Yes/No), with `Age` as a continuous variable.

### Inclusion Criteria
- Binary classification task appropriate for logistic regression
- Sufficient feature count (>10)
- Healthcare relevance
- Appropriate sample size for statistical inference

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data preparation steps include:
- Encoding categorical variables (Yes/No → 1/0)
- Verifying data types and value ranges
- Checking for missing or invalid values
- Renaming columns for consistency and clarity
- Separating predictors and target variable

No rows were removed due to missing data; all records were retained for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA focused on understanding relationships between risk factors and lung cancer diagnosis.

Key components:
- Frequency distributions of binary variables
- Age distribution stratified by diagnosis
- Pairwise comparisons between smoking, alcohol use, exercise, and diagnosis
- Correlation analysis for binary predictors

Visualizations include:
- Bar charts
- Boxplots
